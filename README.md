# choose-your-university

This is my hack for the Same Home Different Hacks hackathon.

# Plans

1. Build a website for all universities to upload details about themselves.
2. Students can login through this website and have a look at what each of these universites offer.
3. They also have an option to apply to the university.

# How much is done.

1. Have decided on using django for the backend.
2. Set up django and trying to the authentication part for students and universities.
